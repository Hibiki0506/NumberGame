# NumberGame

This is a little command line-based game written in C++.

In this game you can 10 times to guess a number between 1 and 100.
If you guess the number correctly, you win!


Originally, this was a task in my class in school for VBA Excel, where we had to write it in Visual Basic.
But now I want to learn C++ and so I came to the idea that I could learn with some tasks from my school.

If you find anything wrong with this little game, please feel free to open an issue. 

Thank you and I wish you good luck! ^^
